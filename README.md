# [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.6331654.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6331654) [![Run tests](https://github.com/curio-sitas/FiberNlse.jl/actions/workflows/build_pkg_tests.yml/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/curio-sitas/FiberNlse.jl/actions/workflows/build_pkg_tests.yml)
 A non-linear SchrÃ¶dinger equation solver for julia aimed towards fiber optics. (ðŸš§ Under development)

## Features

The *FiberNlse.jl* package simulates the propagation of an optical field envelope signal of duration **T** in an optical fiber of length *L*. The chromatic dispersion (**D**) and SPM (self-phase modulation) (**Î³**) wich arises from **Kerr** non-linearity are taken as parameters.

The core of the simulation consists in the integration of the *Non-Linear SchrÃ¶dinger Equation* with the desired signal as initial condition.

---

## Examples
### SechÂ² Soliton
One can simulate the propagation of sechÂ² soliton (order N=2) in an SMF-28 optical fiber by typing the following script :
![sech2_code](images/sech2_code.png)

Wich gives the following result :

### Self-phase modulation
### Time-lens compression
### Other types of solitons
### Soliton collision ? (Maybe)

## Installation
To install you can simply type :
```
] add FiberNlse
```
in your julia terminal or clone this repository and include the `src/FiberNlse.jl` file in your project.

## Roadmap

- [x] Implement Split-Step Method
- [x] Add progress bar option
- [x] Register DOI
- [ ] Document code
- [x] Setup continuous integration
- [ ] Add non constant dispersion (and higher order dispersion)
- [ ] Create a documentation page (mdbook ?)
- [ ] Higher order integral solver (**DifferentialEquations.jl**)
- [ ] Add more non-linear processes (Raman & Brillouin scattering)
